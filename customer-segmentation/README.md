# Customer Segmentation

In this notebook, I use some client data to create a KMeans model to perform customer segmentation.

Customer segmentation consists of dividing clients into groups of individuals based on similar characteristics, such as demographic or user engagement.

Segmentation is mostly used for boosting marketing campaigns, as it allows companies to personalize communication and identify upselling/cross-selling opportunities.
