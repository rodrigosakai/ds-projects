# Digit recognition project


In this notebook, we will explore potencially one of the most popular datasets available on Kaggle: the Digit Recognition. We are given records of 28x28 pixel images that represent drawings of numbers and their respective labels. Each feature displays the intensity of the pixel in the Greyscale.

Our objective is to use this data to create a model capable of classifying unlabeled images.
