# Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we will be using the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial.

It contains a dataset of movie reviews, in which the label column is the sentiment behind the critique. We will use it to train a Natural Language Processing model to predict whether an unlabeled commentary has positive or negative sentiment.
