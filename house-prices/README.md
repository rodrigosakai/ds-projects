# House Prices

In this project, we attempt to create a regression model capable of estimating the sale price of a house based on its features.

Since the dataset contains numerous variables, we had to do some Feature Engineering to deal with missing values and create insightful variables.

Also, by combining multiple models into a Stacked one, we were able to minimize erros due to bias and variance.
