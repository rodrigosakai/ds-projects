# House Prices

In this project, we attempt to create a regression model capable of estimating the sale price of a house based on its features.

Since the dataset contains numerous variables, we have to do some Feature Engineering to deal with missing values and create insightful variables.

We employ a Stacked Regressor as the final model. By combining multiple models into a Stacked one, we are able to minimize erros due to bias and variance.
