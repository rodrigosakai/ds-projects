# Welcome to my Data Science repository!

I've always enjoyed learning by practicing - no wonder why I loved programming as soon as I got in touch with it. I use this repository to upload some side Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling projects that I develop on public datasets (most of them are available on Kaggle).

If you have any comments, suggestions, or critics on any analysis on this repository, please feel free to contact me!

Thanks for your visit.
