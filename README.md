# Welcome to my Data Science repository!

I've always enjoyed learning by practicing - no wonder why I ended up loving programming. So I use this repository to upload some side projects on Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling that I develop based on public datasets (most of them are available on Kaggle).

If you have any comments, suggestions, or critics on the analysis on this repository, please feel free to contact me!

Thanks for your visit.
