# Welcome to my Data Science repository!

Since I've always enjoyed learning by practicing (no wonder why I ended up loving programming as soon as I got in touch with it), I use this repository to upload my side projects on Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling. The datasets I use are usually on Kaggle.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or critics on the analysis on this repository, please feel free to contact me!

Thanks for your visit.
